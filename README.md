## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd frontend
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Open in browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default)

---

## Notes

* **Role-based routing** is handled via `AuthContext`
* Currently uses **placeholder data**, backend API can be connected later
* Tailwind CSS classes are used for styling, Lucide icons for the UI
* Sidebar and dashboards are **responsive** and ready for further expansion

If you want, I can also make a **combined README for both frontend + backend** so you have one clean doc for the full system.  

Do you want me to do that?
